    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>The classic macaroni and cheese made using my home recipe.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 packet of macaroni (200-300g)</li>
        <li>500-600ml of milk</li>
        <li>1 cup of water</li>
        <li>Mozzarella cheese and an additional cheese of your choice (Swiss, Parmesan, or Cheddar work well)</li>
        <li>Optional vegetables (diced) and/or chicken (cooked, cut into bite-sized chunks)</li>
        <li>Salt, black pepper, and red chili flakes (as needed)</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Preparation</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Pour the milk into a large pot with the water and put the uncooked macaroni in.</li>
        <li>Add about 3-4 tablespoons of salt (and optional veggies and chicken) and begin cooking at medium-high heat.</li>
        <li>As the milk begins to thicken, stir lightly but constantly to prevent the milk from burning and the pasta from sticking to the bottom.</li>
        <li>Once the pasta is cooked and the milk reaches a creamy, sauce like consistency, reduce the heat to low.</li>
        <li>Add the rest of the seasonings and a portion of your cheese. Once it melts and mixes in, continue adding and stirring the same way until all of it is incorporated.</li>
        <li>Turn off the heat, ladle out the pasta into a serving tray or plate and enjoy!</li>
    </ol>

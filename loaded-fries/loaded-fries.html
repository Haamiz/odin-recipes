    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Loaded fries are simply french fries topped with a mix of cheese, chicken, a mild flavored sauce, a savory sauce and optionally some vegetables.
    </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>French fries (cooked and seasoned lightly with salt)</li>
        <li>Ranch sauce, Garlic Mayonnaise, or regular Mayonnaise (for the mild sauce)</li>
        <li>Tabasco, Chipotle or some other hot sauce (the savory sauce)</li>
        <li>A mix of Mozzarella and another cheese of your choice (can be cheddar, parmesan, etc.)</li>
        <li>Cooked Chicken cut into bite-sized pieces</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Preparation</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Place a layer of fries in a deep but narrow oven-safe baking dish. The layer should be 1-french fry thick.</li>
        <li>Put some of your chicken (and veggies, if prepped), some of your mild and savory sauces and some of your cheeses on top of the fries, in that order.</li>
        <li>Next lay the fries again, same way as before, followed by the ingredients until you reach the top of your baking dish.</li>
        <li>Make sure that for the last layer you pour all of your cheese on top to create a nice even layer.</li>
        <li>Place the tray into a preheated oven at 300F or 150C and bake until the cheese is fully melted and you start to see some brown spots on it.</li>
        <li>Take out the dish, let it cool for 5-10 minutes before cutting the loaded-fries into lasagna-like chunks and serving.</li>
    </ol>
